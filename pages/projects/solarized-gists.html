title: Solarized theme for embedded Gists
tags: jekyll, web, css
published: True
repo_link: https://github.com/tiborsimon/solarized-gist
version: v1.2
modified: 2015-06-16
share_buttons: True
Date: 2015-04-19
Slug: projects/solarized-gist

I am a big fan of the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme. I use it wherever I can, and my embedded code snippets on my site aren't an exception. In this article I will demonstrate a method that will turn your [gist's](gist.github.com) normal style into a much more elegant Solarized one.

After reading this artice, you will be able to theme your Gists in light or dark Solarized color theme:

<img src="http://tiborsimon.github.io/images/solarized-gist/solarized-gist-demo-image.png" />

## Features

- Unique appearance embedded code snippets
- Solarized light or dark theme with further customization options
- Full featured embedded Gist with all standard features
- Pure CSS solution (static and SASS version)

{% include repo_and_release.html %}

## Early solution and motivation

I was looking for the best way to post source code on my Jekyll based site[^1]. Since Jekyll sites use [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org), it is a pretty reasonable first thought that using the provided syntax highlighting methods will be sufficient enough.

I am using the [HPSTR](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme) jekyll theme hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme uses Kramdown to process the markdown text, and [Pygments](http://pygments.org) to handle the syntax colorings. To get the desired solarized theme, I just had to create a custom CSS file.

A bit of later, I came up with the custom `_pygments.css` file. I started to write this article, and bang.. I randomly tested the article by pushing it to GitHub, and I was sent by a nice message about a page build failure..

<blockquote>
The page build failed with the following error:

The file `assets/css/main.scss` contains syntax errors. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-markdown-errors.
<cite>GitHub Pages staff</cite>
</blockquote>

My investigation resulted, that the CSS source code I tried to showcase in the article caused the problems. Since the CSS code contains classes called `.highlight` it conflicted with the _Liquid_ tags of the syntax highlighting blocks. Bummer. I am using GitHub Pages for hosting, so I can not modify the compilation tools. I need an other way to present source code on my site.


## Using Gists

On my previous Wordpress based site I used Gists as source code showcase tool. I found that this is the bast way among the others that uses various Wordpress plugins.

Gists provides a perfect versioned way to showcase codes. It has one downside though. It looks a bit outdated for me. I don't like the pure white background, the dark font colors, and the sharp corners.

###It's time for a heavy CSS refactoring. 

Using the `!important` CSS declaration it is possible to overwrite the default rules downloaded as an external CSS file. My Jekyll configuration uses [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) so I was able to use CSS variables.

The biggest problem during the refactoring was that Pygments and the syntax highlighter used by Gist uses a completely different CSS class system. I had to map the two class systems to be able to achieve a close approximation of the original Solarized coloring.

| Pygments CSS classes   |      Gist CSS classes      |

There are some imperfections though, due to the different CSS class systems that I couldn't resolve. I will publish almost exclusively Python source code, so I map the two class system to minimize the difference in Python syntax coloring. 

The known issues are the following:

- In the original Solarized coloring the `@property` tag is blue, with my solution the `@` sign is blue, the following `property` is brown.

- The `from` and `import` keywords are greens instead of purple.

- String formatting blocks are equally greens.

## Live demo

<div id="demo"></div>

The following code snippet contains a python code wide enough to trigger the scroll feature of the embedded gist content.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tiborsimon/d1551331a83abd0c7f8d.js"></script>

## Solution using SASS

The predefined variables for the syntax coloring provides a very convenient way to create a template CSS code first, and then fine tune the variables later.

_Make sure you are using SASS to preprocess your CSS files otherwise this method won't work for you, and you only be able to use the basic CSS solution with hard coded color values._


## Solution with basic CSS

If you are not using a CSS preprocessor, there is a compiled solution for you. I replaced all variables and functions used by SASS for the Solarized light and dark style too. Since it's contains hard coded color codes it is much more harder to customize, so if you want so do so, I recommend starting with the SASS version and replace the variables with your custom color codes.


## Contribution

Contributions are welcomed as well as tips and suggestions for the project. If you want to discuss anything according to the project, you can do it on the Gitter thread of the project

{% include repo_and_release.html %}

## Summary

This CSS trick provide you the opportunity to post solarized code snippets to your site. One refinement could be a javascript script that prevents the site to load the original Gist CSS file, but since it isn't a huge overhead, I left it there.

I hope you have found this project useful :)


[^1]: If you are not familiar with the story, I have switched from Wordpress to Jekyll. The reason was simple: Wordpress is a fantastic platform with lots and lots of customizations, but it has a major _(and a few smaller)_ drawback: it is dynamic. I.e. it is slow as hell.. It can be attacked and hacked too, it has WYSIWYG editor which sucks, versioning is almost impossible with it. I am going to write a whole article about my switch.
